Our project: build an artificial intelligence that can play tictactoe. Ideally it well learn, or at least experiment with different moves while deciding what to do. Partially inspired by "Alpha Go" which beat the (human) world champion.
Plans: build a 4x4x4 game in 3D with 3D rendering.
Copies of our software are on github.com/mroam/tictactoebot (https://github.com/mroam/tictactoebot) and old versions are archived on the local page OUR_SOFTWARE.
Interesting info: react.dev (which has example of remembering 3x3 tictactoe game moves in https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe ).
