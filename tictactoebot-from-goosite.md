Our project: build an artificial intelligence that can play tictactoe. Ideally it well learn, or at least experiment with different moves while deciding what to do. Partially inspired by "Alpha Go" ( https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo ) which beat (human) world champions in 2016 and 2017. Alpha Go has been succeeded and beaten by self-taught "Alpha Zero" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero ).


Plans: build a 4x4x4 game in 3D with 3D rendering.


Copies of our software are on github.com/mroam/tictactoebot (https://github.com/mroam/tictactoebot) and old versions are archived on the local page OUR_SOFTWARE.


Interesting info: https://react.dev (which has example of remembering 3x3 tictactoe game moves in https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe ).
