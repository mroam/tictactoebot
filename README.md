***TicTacToe Game*** with AI that learns, with 3D 4x4x4 games
The "ttt4_bluej" directory is the newest, is 2017 Apr, and has started to transition from old Canvas to JPanel. 

This github repository has a ttt4_blueJ folder which contains a "www.BlueJ.org" Java applet program that plays 4x4x4 ticTacToe (3D) and watches for possible wins for itself and for its human opponent. (Colorcoded as warnings for the human.)
The AI jumps at opportunities to win and to block the human from winning, and we hope to improve the AI so that it, like Alpha Go, learns from projected games (using Monte Carlo methods) and from previous games.

There is more information in the README inside the ttt4 folder, and at our website https://sites.google.com/a/saintannsny.org/tictactoebot/home (that google website is replicated here in https://github.com/mroam/tictactoebot/blob/master/tictactoebot-from-goosite.txt and )

I wonder whether we'll be able to make the Java Applet playable online? I started building it twenty years ago and it needs a "Swing" GUI update...
