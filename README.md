# tictactoebot
TicTacToe Game with AI that learns, with 3D 4x4x4 games

This github repository contains a "www.BlueJ.org" Java program that plays 4x4x4 ticTacToe (3D) and watches for possible wins for itself and for its human opponent. (Colorcoded as warnings for the human.)
The AI jumps at opportunities to win and to block the human from winning, and we hope to improve the AI so that it, like Alpha Go, learns from projected games (Monte Carlo) and from previous games.

There is more information in the README inside the ttt4 folder, and at our website https://sites.google.com/a/saintannsny.org/tictactoebot/home

I wonder whether we'll be able to make the Java Applet playable online? I started building it twenty years ago and it needs a "Swing" GUI update...
